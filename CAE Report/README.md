# ATV Steering Components Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed analysis of various steering components of an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV). It includes stress tests, deformation analysis, and fatigue analysis of the front knuckle, rear knuckle, front wheel hub, rear wheel hub, tie rod, and tripod plate. 

## Components Analyzed

- **Front Knuckle**: Analyzed for maximum stress, deformation, and factor of safety.
- **Rear Knuckle**: Tested for stress under various forces including bump and lateral forces.
- **Front Wheel Hub**: Fatigue analysis predicting the life cycle under different stress levels.
- **Rear Wheel Hub**: Similar analysis to the front wheel hub with infinite life under certain conditions.
- **Tie Rod**: Examined for buckling under stress and deformation criteria.
- **Tripod Plate**: Assessed for Von Mises stress and overall safety factor.

## Methodology

The analyses involve computational simulations to predict the behavior of each component under operational stresses. The results include Von Mises stress distributions, deformation patterns, and factors of safety for each part, presented through a series of figures.

## Results

The results indicate that each component can withstand the operational stresses with varying degrees of safety. Specific findings for each component are detailed in the corresponding sections.

## Conclusion

The steering components of the ATV are generally found to perform within acceptable safety margins. Some components show exceptional durability, indicating an infinite life span under normal stress conditions.
